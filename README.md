The Face Recognition-Based Attendance and Security System is an advanced solution designed 
to automate and streamline attendance tracking while simultaneously enhancing security 
protocols within educational institutions, organizations, and high-security environments. This 
system leverages cutting-edge facial recognition technology, built on the face-recognition 
library by Adam Geitgey, and integrates with OpenCV for real-time face detection and 
recognition. It provides a seamless and efficient way to mark attendance, ensuring accuracy and 
eliminating the possibility of proxy attendance, all while offering enhanced security features 
for restricted access areas.
